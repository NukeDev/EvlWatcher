2020-07-01 EvlWatcher-v2.0 beta 1. RELEASE NOTES, and how to test.

- EvlWatcher 2.0 is now running on .NetFramework 4.7.2, which is the default framework for Windows servers (2019, ver1809, ver1803) -> see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/migration-guide/versions-and-dependencies
- EvlWatcher 2.0 is now using a better software architecture pattern, making it easier to change and adapt in the future
- EvlWatcher 2.0 is now using a different configuration file structure
- EvlWatcher 2.0 should fix the ram usage problem of the previous versions
- EvlWatcher 2.0 BETA 1 is released without a console

How to test beta 1:

- Install EvlWatcher
	- there should be no need to install previous versions, it will be replaced. if that doesnt work, please report that in the pull request

- you can set the loglevel to "Debug" for a full output. Just dont leave it that way, your eventlog will grow.

- once you have the impression it runs stable, leave it running for a few days, to find out if it still uses massive amounts of RAM over the time.

- Evlwatcher should still recognize IPs out the event log, according to config.xml
	- if there are any adjustments to be made to these rules, also let me know please.

Thanks for your help in testing EvlWatcher. Once those things work, I will move on to the EvlWatcher Console.
